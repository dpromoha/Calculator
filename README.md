# Calculator

The first calculator has invented a lot of years ago. It was heavy and difficult to understand. It`s been a while since this dark and more important inconvenient time end. But now, almost all of us have an opportunity to use a calculator on our smartphones. Almost every device, has the opportunity to count a tip or wasted money. Can this experience be called successful or comfortable? There are not many who noticed it, who **enjoys this experience.**

As they like to say in Apple, I try to **"rethink"** an ordinary design. So, this is my way of looking at a calculator.

More attention to buttons, less attention to strict colors. You can always choose another color, that makes your visual perception a much better.

Without going into detail I try for the first time:
 • MVC
 • Dark Mode
